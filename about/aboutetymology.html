            <h2>Rashad</h2>
            <p>Rashad (رشاد) is an Arabic male given name, meaning perception and awareness, guidance and righteousness, and being led on the path of truth, hitting the right approach and the correct path. It is the opposite of error and misguidance.</p>
            <h2>Nur Shams</h2>
            <p>Nur (نور) means Light, and Shams (شمس) means Sun. Hence, Nur Shams means Sun Light or Sunshine. The reason why the area is called Nur Shams backs to the region's history. There was a dungeon in that area during the period of British colonialism in Palestine. That dungeon was underground, and sunlight did not reach it. Some people were put in that dungeon for a certain period, then they were released. When they were released they saw the sun light for the first time after the end of their imprisonment period. Thus, they called the area Sun Light, or Nur Shams.</p>
