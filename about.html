            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>My name is Rashad Hamidi. I was born in Nablus, Palestine. My family from my father's side is from Sabbarin, Haifa, Palestine, and my mother's side is from Nablus, Palestine. I was raised in Nurshams Refugee Camp, Tulkarm, Palestine, so I'm considered as an internal refugee.</p>
            <h2>Speciality</h2>
            <p>I have a BSc in Physics from Birzeit University, an MSc in Mathematics [in Particles, Strings and Cosmology] from Durham University, and currently a PhD in Mathematics [in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics Group] student at Durham University.</p>
