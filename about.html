            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>My name is Rashad Hamidi. I was born in Mount Ebal, Nablus, Palestine, and raised in Nur Shams Refugee Camp, Tulkarm, Palestine, so I'm considered an internal refugee. My family from my father's side is from Sabbarin, Haifa, Palestine, and my mother's side is from Talluza, Nablus, Palestine.</p>
            <h2>Etymology of My Name</h2>
            <p>Rashad (رشاد) is an Arabic male given name, meaning perception and awareness, guidance and righteousness, and being led on the path of truth, hitting the right approach and the correct path. It is the opposite of error and misguidance.</p>
